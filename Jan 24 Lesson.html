		<p>It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me. This is what happens when an unstoppable force (science teacher) meets an immovable object (batman). You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?  You either die a science teacher or live long enough to become batman. She's the teacher science students need but Gotham needs her more. She's more than our hero, she's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight." </p>
